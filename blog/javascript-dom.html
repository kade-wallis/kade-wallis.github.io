    <div><h1>JS Fundamentals</h1></div>

    <p>
      A good way to understand JavaScript is to first explain the basics of a
      website. Websites are essentially are tool to open and view simple text
      files. When we use a text file for a website, we will use the .HTML
      format. HTML files alone are a bit booring to look at as they contain
      simple text. We can make them more interesting by adding colors, fonts,
      borders etc. We can call this styling and is best done by linking a .CSS
      file to the original .HTML file we have used for our website. The .CSS
      file will contain special code designed to add style attributes to the
      text in the .HTML file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we want to add interactivity or dynamic elements to a website, we need
      a more powerful tool. One of these tools is called Javascript. JavaScript
      works the same way as a .CSS files does. All we need to do is to link our
      original .HTML file to a new JavaScript file (.JS). Similar to the .CSS
      file, the .JS file will contain special code designed to manipulate or add
      to the content of the .HTML file.
    </p>

    <h2>Anology</h2>
    <p>
      If a website was a house, HTML would be the structure, CSS would be
      interior aestetic design and JS would the electrical, plumbing, appliances
      etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Control Flow & Loops Explained</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom by default. There are tools
      to change the order of this execution. These tools are known as control
      flow statements. One of these tools - Loops, is listed below:
    </p>

    <p>
      A loop allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain
      condition is met. This would be similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle, where
      you would put the puzzle peices together one by one until you run out of
      puzzle peices.
    </p>

      style="width: auto; height: 250px"
    />

    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is used to view and interact with the
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript content. This is done directly in a web browser.
      As an example, you may want to change the size of a containers padding,
      this can be done in a visual way and in real time using the DOM.
    </p>

      src="../images/DOM-pic.png"
      alt="Image of the DOM"
      style="width: auto; height: 500px"
    />

    <h2>Objects, Arrays And The Data They Contain</h2>
    <p>
      Both object and arrays are used to store data. Arrays are ordered or
      indexed. This means each element are assigned a number and ordered
      numerically starting from 0. Object on the other hand, Objects store data
      as "key-value pairs". This means they are stored and accessed by a unique
      identifier.
    </p>

      style="width: auto; height: 210px"
    />

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can be
      reused and reffered to when necessary.
