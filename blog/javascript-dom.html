    <p>A good way to understand JavaScript is to first explain the basics of a website. 
    Websites are essentially are tool to open and view simple text files. When we use a text file for a website, we will use the .HTML format.
    HTML files alone are a bit booring to look at as they contain simple text.
    We can make them more interesting by adding colors, fonts, borders etc. 
    We can call this styling and is best done by linking a .CSS file to the original .HTML file we have used for our website. 
    The .CSS file will contain special code designed to add style attributes to the text in the .HTML file.</p>


    <p>If we want to add interactivity or dynamic elements to a website, we need a more powerful tool. One of these tools is called Javascript.
    JavaScript works the same way as a .CSS files does. All we need to do is to link our original .HTML file to a new JavaScript file (.JS).
    Similar to the .CSS file, the .JS file will contain special code designed to manipulate or add to the content of the .HTML file.</p>

    <p>If a website was a house, HTML would be the structure, CSS would be interior aestetic design and JS would the electrical, plumbing, appliances etc.
