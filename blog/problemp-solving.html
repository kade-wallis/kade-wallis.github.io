    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>

    <h3>1. Blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

    What was the problem?<br />
    My code wasn't able to pass the last question in a test.<br /><br />
    What problem-solving techniques did you use?<br />
    I had exhausted most of my problem solving techniques, so I asked for help
    with the facilitator.<br /><br />
    How did you feel throughout the process? <br />
    I was curious to find a solution as I knew it would probably be a simple
    error somewhere. <br /><br />
    What did you learn?<br />
    Sometimes no matter how hard you try to solve a problem, you may not have
    the means to remedy it.

    <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>

    What was the problem? <br />
    I had a complicated piece of code which was almost passing a test but not
    quite. <br /><br />
    What problem-solving techniques did you use? <br />
    I had just learned how to use console.log. I deleted all my original code
    and started from scratch. I wrote simple code based on the instructions
    given. I was able to verify each piece of code along the way with
    console.log. Within 20 mins I was able to pass the test. My previous
    complicated code had taken me several hours. <br /><br />
    How did you feel throughout the process? <br />
    Very frustrated until I understood console.log, then it was quite fun.
    <br /><br />
    What did you learn? <br />
    Without console.log, you are working blind. As you have no way to verify
    code along the way, you have no option but to randomly insert code and hope
    that it all works out in the end.

    <h3>
      3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h3>

    Pseudocode <br />
    I found this very helpful as it puts some sort of context to the sometimes
    confusing code. <br /><br />
    Trying something <br />
    This is my go to. I don't really like it though because it often doesn't
    teach you why you are doing what your doing. <br /><br />
    Rubber ducky method<br />
    So far this has only proved helpful to unload frustration. I'm not sure it
    has helped my solve a problem just yet.
    <br /><br />
    Reading error messages <br />
    Very helpful, I enjoy reading the messages now as it is a great tool
    understand not only, what you've done wrong but also why its wrong.
    <br /><br />
    Console.logging <br />
    I started off with little to no confidence in Console.log. After
    understanding the concept a bit better, I am very confident using it.
    <br /><br />
    Googling <br />
    Very confident with this. Looking at examples of code is very helpful.
    <br /><br />
    Asking your peers for help<br />
    I am less confident asking peers for help. I am concerned they may not have
    the capacity to offer the help that I require. If its a simple query its not
    a problem, but then a simple query can easily be answered by google.<br /><br />
    Asking coaches for help <br />
    I am confident in asking coaches for help. This is because I know I will get
    a thorough and in-depth walk through of any given problem. I mostly use this
    when I am completely lost. <br /><br />
    Improving your process with reflection<br />
    I am confident using this, although I dont utilize it enough.

    <h3>
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h3>
    I am reluctant to ask for help before I have exhausted all other options. I
    think this is because I have a deep belief you can teach yourself just about
    anything. Sometimes this can be a waste of time, sometimes you just don't
    know what you don't know. I will try harder in the future to determine what
    is the best use of time, asking for help or figuring it out alone.<br /><br />
