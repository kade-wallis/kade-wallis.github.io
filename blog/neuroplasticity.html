  Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial in multiple

  responsive to inputs.

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<p>
  In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
  <br />
  Although I have previously been exposed to the concept, what did surprise me
  was how far back to the fixed mindset I have reverted.
  <br />
  <br />
  How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
  <br />
  When things start to get hard, I will remember that this is a great place to
  be, it forces you to keep at it or dig deeper.

  Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
  learning plan and strategy.
  <br />
  <br />
  I will incorporate the growth mindset into my learning plan. One reason is
  because, it acts like a "get out of jail free card". When you cant see a
  solution to a problem, often you end up confining the solution pool. A growth
  mindset can allow you to step back and see different perspectives and whole
  new solutions.
