    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Long term goal or career pathway.</h2>

    My long term goal is to create a web app or product that has some purpose
    and is beneficial and helpful to many.

    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations</h2>

    My biggest strength is an eagerness to learn. This will make it easier when
    encountering problems, problems equal more learnings. I have two major
    limitations. I'm very slow at reading so it takes me a while to process
    written information. I also have a relatively slow processing brain which
    again means it takes me a while to process and retain information.

    <h2>Skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>

    It would be great to gain tools and skills to work productively with others.

    <h2>Working productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators</h2>

    I will focus on clear communication with others. Listening actively to
    understand will be helpful.

    <h2>
      Things top do when problems are building up and starting to get to me
    </h2>

    Take a break. Chat to other learners or facilitators to unload and share the
    issue.

    <h2>Seeking help</h2>

    I will actively ask for help when encountering a problem that I cant solve
    in a reasonable amount of time. I will reach out to other learners or
    facilitators.

    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    I would expect the facilitators to be ready to help with any queries.

    <h2>Scheduling external commitments</h2>

    I have external commitments as I run my own business. I will schedule these
    commitments within my study time. My fixed hours for study are 9.00-5.00pm.
    If I need time for study outside of these hours, my homelife is flexible and
    can accommodate for the extra time required.
