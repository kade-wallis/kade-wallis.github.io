    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Long term goal or career pathway.</h2>

    <p>
      My long term goal is to create a web app or product that has some purpose
      and is beneficial and helpful to many.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations</h2>

    <p>
      My biggest strength is an eagerness to learn. This will make it easier
      when encountering problems, problems equal more learnings. I have two
      major limitations. I'm very slow at reading so it takes me a while to
      process written information. I also have a relatively slow processing
      brain which again means it takes me a while to process and retain
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>

    <p>
      It would be great to gain tools and skills to work productively with
      others.
    </p>

    <h2>Working productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators</h2>

    <p>
      I will focus on clear communication with others. Listening actively to
      understand will be helpful.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Things top do when problems are building up and starting to get to me
    </h2>

    <p>
      Take a break. Chat to other learners or facilitators to unload and share
      the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>Seeking help</h2>

    <p>
      I will actively ask for help when encountering a problem that I cant solve
      in a reasonable amount of time. I will reach out to other learners or
      facilitators.
    </p>

    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    <p>I would expect the facilitators to be ready to help with any queries.</p>

    <h2>Scheduling external commitments</h2>

    <p>
      I have external commitments as I run my own business. I will schedule
      these commitments within my study time. My fixed hours for study are
      9.00-5.00pm. If I need time for study outside of these hours, my homelife
      is flexible and can accommodate for the extra time required.
