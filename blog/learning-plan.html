    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    My goal is to learn enough about web development so I am able to create and
    work on web apps by myself. The idea is to create a web app that solves
    someone's problem.
    <br /><br />

    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    Biggest strengths: Stickability, curiosity, <br />
    Biggest limitations: becoming very frustrated easily, slow processing brain,
    dyslexia<br />
    I still feel the same about these strengths and weaknesses as I did in
    sprint 2. Although, I have been more easily frustrated than anticipated.<br />

    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h2>
    Working with others, I sometimes struggle broadcast my thoughts and opinions
    in a palatable way.<br /><br />

    <h2>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    It would be great if I could get better at communicating with others. Also
    learning to take more of a leadership role would be awesome.<br /><br />

    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    I would expect support when im struggling with an issue. This would be a
    voice call to talk things through. Although I don't expect it, validation
    goes a long way.<br /><br />

    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
    I will ask a facilitator or other students if I cant sort an issue within a
    given time period.<br /><br />

    <h2>Commitment of how I will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
    I will commit myself 8.30-5.00pm everyday. I will be conscious of how I'm
    feeling in both my body and mind. I will take regular breaks when required.
    I will also take a day off if I feel I'm starting to get burned out. If my
    mind and body are looked after, its much easier to get accept new material
    and also get along with people. This is especially the case in a fast-paced
    intensive environment.<br />

    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Long term goal or career pathway.</h2>

    <p>
      My long term goal is to create a web app or product that has some purpose
      and is beneficial and helpful to many.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations</h2>

    <p>
      My biggest strength is an eagerness to learn. This will make it easier
      when encountering problems, problems equal more learnings. I have two
      major limitations. I'm very slow at reading so it takes me a while to
      process written information. I also have a relatively slow processing
      brain which again means it takes me a while to process and retain
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>

    <p>
      It would be great to gain tools and skills to work productively with
      others.
    </p>

    <h2>Working productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators</h2>

    <p>
      I will focus on clear communication with others. Listening actively to
      understand will be helpful.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Things top do when problems are building up and starting to get to me
    </h2>

    <p>
      Take a break. Chat to other learners or facilitators to unload and share
      the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>Seeking help</h2>

    <p>
      I will actively ask for help when encountering a problem that I cant solve
      in a reasonable amount of time. I will reach out to other learners or
      facilitators.
    </p>

    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    <p>I would expect the facilitators to be ready to help with any queries.</p>

    <h2>Scheduling external commitments</h2>

    <p>
      I have external commitments as I run my own business. I will schedule
      these commitments within my study time. My fixed hours for study are
      9.00-5.00pm. If I need time for study outside of these hours, my homelife
      is flexible and can accommodate for the extra time required.
