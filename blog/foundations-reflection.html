    What surprised me the most about Human Skills learning is....<br />

    I was most surprised how powerful this content can be. When its applied to
    my learning environment it has quite an impact. <br /><br />

    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to
    the Human Skills learning?<br />
    1. I have learned that I am not as good at problem solving as I had
    originally thought. When struggling to learn something, I quickly place
    blame on external factors. <br />
    2. When I am frustrated, the answers to questions get harder to find. <br />
    3. I can apply what I've learned in "Human Skills" to make problem solving
    much smoother. <br /><br />
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
    programming? <br />
    These roles are important because they can help to ground yourself. When
    grounded its easier to see thing for what they are. They can create a deeper
    situational awareness. This can be especially helpful when working with
    colleagues. <br /><br />
    What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?<br />
    How there is great stuff to be learned but how easily it is all forgotten
    and how quickly I revert back to my normal self. <br /><br />
    What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?<br />
    Exploring my identity/values and how to put that down on paper.<br /><br />
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
    focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    <br />
    To create well rounded graduates who will be able to function in a working
    with others type environment. <br /><br />
    Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
    waste of time? <br />
    Yes and no. <br /><br />
    Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?<br />
    I have no aspirations to either, get a job programming or to work with
    others so I would prefer to spend this time learning more about
    programming.<br /><br />
