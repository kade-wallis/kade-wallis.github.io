      <h2>Ethical Decision</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a builder and for a period of time I contracted myself out to a
        particular company. I had started my apprenticeship with this company so
        it was nice to go back later on in my career and work within a familiar
        environment. The owner of the company was a fun guy to be around and
        considered him a friend. Unfortunately, he also had a toxic personality.
        After being let down by him time and time again, I eventually had to
        make the decision to cut ties and never work with him again. Working for
        this company offered me a stable and reliable source of work when
        required. In the end I had to uphold my values and leave the toxic
        environment and sacrifice the stable income. When I reflect on it now, I
        am proud of that decision. I do however wish I had done it sooner.

      <h2>Values & Identity</h2>
      <p>
        I was raised in a "figure it out for yourself" culture which I guess has
        led to my continuous self learning. This has a downside, not actively
        asking for help has became my default. Though I really value the idea of
        asking for help, this can be a struggle sometimes. After getting
        married, my biggest influence is my wife. Being is a psychologist, she
        has taught me great deal about how humans tick. This has really shaped
        my interactions with others and made me more empathetic.

      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength is an eagerness so learn. This will make it easier
        when encountering problems, problems equal more learnings.

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest limitation I believe I have is slow processing. It takes me
        a while to process and understand information. This is compounded by
        likely having mild dyslexia. It can make it hard to keep up with others
        in a learning environment.

      <h2>Example Of Working With Others</h2>
      <p>
        I was prepping a floor slab to be poured with another contactor on a
        building site. The other contractor was a bit older and considered
        himself to be the one in charge. Neither him nor I were "in charge" as
        we were working together toward the same goal. However, I was the person
        with the most experience doing this particular task. I must have
        portrayed this through my body language and communication because he
        became quite upset when I pointed out some of his work wasn't done as
        per plan. To reduce the tension I tried to state simply, "it cannot be
        done that way". In hindsight this was a poor approach. It just made him
        more angry and his work even worse. After a while he left me to it and I
        essentially started from scratch. If I were to approach this in a better
        way, I could have asked what his reasoning was for doing the work that
        way. If I took the time to understand his way of thinking, he may have
        been more open dialog about the problem. If we were able to chat the
        problem through, maybe we could have ended up with an outcome that we
        were both happy with.
